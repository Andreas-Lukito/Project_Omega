🏷️ Dynamic Pricing Model

This project explores a machine learning approach to dynamic pricing, where the model automatically adjusts product prices based on various business factors.

📌 Project Overview

Built a regression model to automate price adjustment.

Features used:

production_cost

stock

demand_rate

competitor_price

profit_margin

Target variable: final_price.

The dataset was synthetically generated to simulate real-world business conditions.

⚙️ Methodology

Data Simulation: Created a synthetic dataset using statistical distributions to mimic realistic pricing data.

Model Training: Tested multiple machine learning models for regression tasks.

Hyperparameter Optimization: Used GridSearchCV for tuning.

Evaluation: Measured performance using R² score.

📊 Results

Best model achieved 99% R² score on the test set.

Hyperparameter tuning significantly improved performance and reduced overfitting.
