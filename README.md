# 🏷️ Dynamic Pricing Model

This project explores a **machine learning approach to dynamic pricing**, where the model automatically adjusts product prices based on various business factors.

## 📌 Project Overview

* Built a regression model to **automate price adjustment**.
* Features used:

  * `production_cost`
  * `stock`
  * `demand_rate`
  * `competitor_price`
  * `profit_margin`
* Target variable: `final_price`.

The dataset was **synthetically generated** to simulate real-world business conditions.

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. **Data Simulation**: Created a synthetic dataset using statistical distributions to mimic realistic pricing data.
2. **Model Training**: Tested multiple machine learning models for regression tasks.
3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Used **GridSearchCV** for tuning.
4. **Evaluation**: Measured performance using **R² score**.

## 📊 Results

* Best model achieved **99% R² score** on the test set.
* Hyperparameter tuning significantly improved performance and reduced overfitting.
